    question: "Where is the rest of GiTS?"
}

We're being careful by how much we release into the wild.
The aim is to have the most stable version of gits available to the general public.
Until then, we'll just continue releasing enough to get things done. This doesn't stop you from buying a ticket to an event on the platform or creating your own event.
