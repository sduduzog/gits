    question: "Can I print my ticket?"
}

Absolutely! You can, but you don't need to.  We don't want to take up any more of your space in your device as a QR code screenshot, so we've made GiTS tickets flexible enough to be useable and shareable without having to leave the application. If you're going to open your gallery, look for the right screenshot for the ticket you want to use, you might as well use GiTS.
